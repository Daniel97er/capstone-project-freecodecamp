# capstone-project-freecodecamp

This is my final project after completing the “Responsive Web Design” course at freeCodeCamp using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a sample website for a general medical practice. I focused on ensuring that the site works correctly on all devices and is accessible according to the most important standards. The website can be viewed in dark mode and is available in both German and English. It is a single-page website with a fully functional navigation bar. Although it was carefully implemented, some errors may still occur. Some parts of the code were refined with the help of AI. Uses internal CSS and JavaScript for easy local use.

## Here are a few images below to give a first impression.

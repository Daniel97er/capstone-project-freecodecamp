# capstone-project-freecodecamp
Final project after completing freeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design course using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A sample website for a general medical practice, fully responsive, accessible, with dark mode, German and English support, and a functional single-page navigation. Minor errors may occur. Some code parts were refined with AI.
